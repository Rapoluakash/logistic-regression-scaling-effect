# Data Preprocessing Techniques

This repository demonstrates various data preprocessing techniques for machine learning models, such as Min-Max Normalization, Standard Scaling (Z-score), and the usage of raw data without any scaling. Proper data scaling can improve the performance of machine learning models by ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model training.

```

## Data Preprocessing Techniques

Here are the three main preprocessing techniques demonstrated in this repository:

### 1. Without Scaling

This method uses raw data without any normalization or standardization. Some machine learning algorithms (like Decision Trees) do not require scaling, but others may perform poorly with unscaled data.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Split the data into features and target
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### 2. With Min-Max Normalization

Min-Max normalization scales the data to a specific range, usually [0, 1]. This is helpful for algorithms that rely on distances like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Networks.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize the MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Fit and transform the training data
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform the test data using the same scaler
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

### 3. With Standard Scaling (Z-score)

Standard scaling (Z-score normalization) transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is commonly used for algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Initialize the StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit and transform the training data
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Transform the test data using the same scaler
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

## Usage

To apply these preprocessing techniques, simply follow the code snippets above and replace the dataset with your own. The example demonstrates how to handle raw data and scale it using Min-Max normalization or Standard scaling. 

For more advanced usage, you can integrate these techniques into your machine learning pipeline.

## Choosing the Right Scaling Technique

- **Without Scaling**: Use when your algorithm is not sensitive to feature scales (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest).
- **Min-Max Normalization**: Use when you need all features to be in the same range (e.g., Neural Networks, KNN).
- **Standard Scaling (Z-score)**: Use when the algorithm assumes that the data is normally distributed or you want each feature to contribute equally (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression).
